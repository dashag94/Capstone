                    <p>The project I’m showing is a weight-tracking mobile app I built in Android Studio. It includes three main parts: a login screen activity_login.xml, an item class to represent inventory items InventoryItem.java, and an adapter to display those items in a list InventoryAdapter.java. This app was created as part of my mobile app development course and demonstrates some core Android concepts, like user interface design, managing data, and setting up a RecyclerView to show lists of items. I’ve also made improvements to add features and make it more reliable.
I included this app in my portfolio because it shows important skills I’ve developed in Android app creation, from building simple layouts to handling user data securely. I picked this project because it reflects the growth of my skills over time. The login screen, item management, and interactive list all demonstrate my understanding of how to make an app user-friendly and reliable. The enhancements, like better data validation and UI adjustments, show my ability to make apps that are both functional and enjoyable to use. I made sure that each item’s data is accurate by adding checks to catch issues, like preventing negative numbers in the quantity field. I improved the app’s list feature by adding click actions, which allow users to interact with each item directly. This creates a more interactive experience. I improved the login layout to make it both visually appealing and accessible to more users, like adding descriptions that work with screen readers.
I made several changes to improve this app. Originally, it didn’t have checks to catch incorrect data, which could lead to errors. I added validation to ensure that data stays consistent. In `InventoryAdapter.java`, I added click listeners to make each item in the list clickable, creating a smoother user experience. I also adjusted the login layout by switching to a more flexible layout type, which helps the app display properly on different devices and added accessibility features for users with disabilities. These improvements helped me meet my original course goals, like creating interactive and easy-to-use apps that manage data safely. These changes also supported my goal of making the app adaptable for different users and devices. I don’t have any updates to my goals at this time because these changes already aligned well with my course outcomes.
Enhancing this project taught me a lot. I realized that designing for users means thinking ahead about things like data accuracy and accessibility. For example, using ConstraintLayout took some extra time to learn, but it helped the app look consistent across different screen sizes. Making these updates also taught me how even small improvements, like adding click listeners, can make the app feel more responsive and enjoyable to use. This project reinforced the importance of creating apps that are reliable and easy to use from the start.

                    <p>The artifact I selected for my ePortfolio is a pathfinding algorithm project from CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms. This project involves implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It was originally created as part of coursework focused on teaching algorithm design, efficiency, and problem-solving using complex data structures. This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical programming challenges, showcasing skills in graph traversal, efficient data storage, and computational problem-solving.
I chose this artifact because it highlights my ability to work with foundational computer science concepts that are essential for solving real-world problems. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a widely recognized solution for determining the shortest path, and implementing it required a deep understanding of graph structures, priority queues, and algorithmic efficiency. This artifact also reflects my ability to design and analyze solutions while managing trade-offs between computational complexity and clarity of implementation. The project stands out because it not only illustrates my ability to build functional solutions but also my capacity to improve them through thoughtful enhancements.
For this milestone, I enhanced the original artifact by focusing on key areas such as code modularity, edge case handling, performance optimization, and user feedback. First, I refactored the code to make it more modular. Breaking the code into smaller functions, such as graph construction, shortest path calculation, and result display, improved its readability and maintainability. These modular functions can now be reused or adapted more easily for future projects. This change also aligns with best practices in software design, ensuring the artifact meets professional standards.
Next, I addressed edge case handling, which was limited in the original version. I added checks to validate inputs, ensuring that start and end nodes exist within the graph before proceeding. I also implemented logic to handle scenarios where no path exists between the given nodes. These enhancements made the program more robust and user-friendly, as it now provides clear error messages instead of failing silently or producing incorrect results.
In terms of performance, I improved the algorithm by optimizing its data structures. I refined the priority queue operations to reduce overhead during edge relaxation, which is a critical step in Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Additionally, I used an adjacency list representation for the graph, which is more efficient for both space and time compared to other representations like adjacency matrices. These changes ensured that the program could handle larger graphs more effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.
To improve usability, I incorporated enhanced user feedback. The program now includes clear prompts for users to input graph data and specify start and end nodes. It also provides meaningful progress updates during execution and displays results in a more readable format. The shortest path and its total cost are presented step-by-step, ensuring the user can easily follow the output. These improvements make the artifact more interactive and accessible to users who may not have a technical background.
Through these enhancements, I achieved key outcomes related to algorithm design and software development. I demonstrated my ability to analyze and refine an existing solution, incorporating principles of modularity, efficiency, and usability. The process also reinforced the importance of anticipating and addressing edge cases, which is a critical skill for creating reliable software.
Enhancing this artifact was a valuable learning experience. It deepened my understanding of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and graph-based problem-solving while teaching me how to balance algorithmic performance with user-centered design. One challenge I faced was ensuring that the enhancements, such as modularization and performance optimizations, did not inadvertently introduce bugs or reduce the program’s clarity. To overcome this, I conducted extensive testing with various graph configurations, including edge cases like disconnected nodes and invalid inputs. This testing process not only validated the enhancements but also strengthened my problem-solving and debugging skills.
Overall, this artifact reflects my growth as a computer science student and my ability to design effective solutions to complex problems. By including this project in my ePortfolio, I aim to showcase my technical skills, attention to detail, and commitment to creating software that is both efficient and user-friendly. This artifact is a testament to my ability to build on foundational knowledge, adapt to challenges, and deliver high-quality solutions.
